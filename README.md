    To see the content of raw.githubusercontent.com/${repo}/${branch}/${path} in the usual github interface:

        you replace raw.githubusercontent.com with plain github.com
        AND you insert "blob" between the repo name and the branch name.

    In this case, the branch name is "master" (which is a very common branch name), so you replace /master/ with /blob/master/, and so

        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install

        becomes

        https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install
